# PizzaOrder
## Pizza Perfect, the only place to order your perfect topping combos! 
This is a pizza app that I made for an assignment. It is meant to apply the JavaScript theory that we learned.

What I learned from making this project:

- making use of table row, table data, and table cells, using fieldsets and legends in HTML
- validating user input and making sure that required data fields are filled using conditional statements JavaScript
- understanding how parse float works to get the total order amount, with tax included in JavaScript
